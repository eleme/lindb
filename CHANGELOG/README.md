## Change log rules

1. Each patch release only includes changes against previous patch release.
For example, the change log of v3.5.5 should only include items which are new to v3.5.4.
2. For the first release (e.g. 3.4.0, 3.5.0, 3.6.0, 4.0.0 etc.) for each minor or major 
version, it only includes changes which are new to the first release of previous minor
or major version. For example, v3.5.0 should only include items which are new to v3.4.0,
and v3.6.0 should only include items which are new to v3.5.0.
